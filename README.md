# Hey there :wave:

My name's Tatyana and I like to work with data and find patterns in it. 

## About me :information_desk_person:

:v: I am an aspiring Data Scientist from Belgrade, Serbia. I am proficient with Python, SQL and several DS and ML libraries among which are Pandas, NumPy, PyTorch, OpenCV and more.

âœ¨ My passion to explore and try new things in different directions led me to get experience in Data Analysis, Image Processing, NLP and GAN, but I prefer working with VR and NLP. 

:eyes: I constantly refine my skills and learn something new. My current focus is on learning algorithms of neural networks and I also study for Masters in Informatics and Computer Engineering.
